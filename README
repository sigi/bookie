This is a Rails web application to manage a friendly soccer betting
community or office betting pool.

There is UI for user registration, but not much else in that regard.

Everything related to the actual tournament, such as names of teams,
divisions as well as actual matches, can be entered via the UI.  This is
enabled for all users who have the 'admin' attribute set to 'true' in the
database.  This needs to be done manually.

Other than that, it's all a bit rough around the edges, and a lot of the
code needs some serious refactoring.  There are no unit tests.  There is
legacy code as this started out as a Rails 1.2.x application.
